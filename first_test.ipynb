      "SELECT STATEMENT: 'Let's begin with consumer price expectations. If consumers expect lower prices in the future, they are likely to reduce current demand, waiting for prices to drop. This will lead to a leftward shift in the demand curve for corn, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium price and reducing the equilibrium quantity.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Hayes shifts in his position and continues, 'On the supply side, falling input costs mean that producers can produce corn more cheaply. This typically shifts the supply curve to the right, as producers are willing to supply more corn at each price level, thus increasing the equilibrium quantity but again driving down the price.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He concludes, 'In summary, both changes will likely result in a lower equilibrium price for corn. The impact on quantity will depend on the relative magnitude of the shifts, but generally, we should expect an increase in the equilibrium quantity due to lower input costs.'\n",
      "CANDIDATE STATEMENT 1: Dr. Hayes continues, 'Here, the equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall. Consumer expectations of lower prices and reduced input costs could lead to a complex interaction that decreases the quantity.'\n",
      "CANDIDATE STATEMENT 2: Dr. Hayes continues, 'In this case, the equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate. Consumers expecting lower prices will dampen current demand, putting downward pressure on prices. Meanwhile, reduced input costs may lead to an increase in supply. These conflicting forces make the equilibrium quantity indeterminate.'\n",
      "CANDIDATE STATEMENT 3: Dr. Hayes continues, 'In this case, the equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate. Consumers expecting lower prices would typically increase current demand, pushing prices up.'\n",
      "CANDIDATE STATEMENT 4: Dr. Hayes continues, 'In this situation, the equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise. Reduced input costs will increase supply significantly, leading to a rise in equilibrium quantity even if consumer expectations affect demand.'\n",
